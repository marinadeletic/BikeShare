            <h2>Where are people embarking? </h2>
            <p>With hundreds of stations across Manhattan, the map shows how different stations and areas of the city vary in usage. <br> <br>Upper Manhattan saw <em1>low</em1> station usage while middle Manhattan stations had <em2>high</em2> volumes of traffic. This trend is likely due to Middle Manhattan being the home of Times Square, Broadway and many of the cities tourist attractions. The West side also experienced higher traffic than the East. <br> <br>Stations around Central Park have a higher number of uses compared to those around Upper Manhattan that are not adjacent to the park. <br> <br>For a more in-depth exploration of New York City and its attractions visit <a href="https://www.nyctourist.com/map1.htm">NYC Tourist.</a></p>

            <h2>What are Popular Routes?</h2>
            <p>While stations tell us where people embark on their journeys, it is interesting to understand the <em3>popular routes</em3> people in New York take. It is unsurprising that middle and lower Manhattan experience more popular routes than those in Upper Manhattan. However what we can see is that the most popular routes include through Central Park, between Perishing Square and middle Manhattan as well as along the South West Side. </p>

            <h2>When are people traveling?</h2>
            <p>Day of week and time of day play a role in the number of people traveling. Wednesday's had the highest average usage in June, with Tuesday and Thursday following close behind. While Monday's and Sunday's had the lowest usage. The <em4>weekdays</em4> saw a very clear usage pattern each day, usage would pick up for the morning rush hour, drop and plateau and then pickup higher than the morning for the evening rush hour. The <em5>weekends</em5> saw a much more gradual increase over the day peaking in the afternoon.</p>

            <h2>The Influence of Weather </h2>
            <p>It was expected that there would be some variation in the average distance travelled on a day given the weather. The graph illustrates that cold days see lower average distance travelled. <br><br>Precipitation (rain) did not appear to have a large impact on the distance travelled however this may be due to relatively small amounts of rain experienced during June. <br><br>Generally the less humid days saw higher average distances travelled.</p>

            <p>An analysis of the population of riders shows that a lower portion of riders are females. Those between the ages of 20-40 are the greatest number of riders. Males between the age of 30-40 are the largest portion of the bike sharing population in New York City making up 23% of the ridership.  </p>
